Company can base on the EA framework to make decision about which best practices need to apply.

2. Who do you think should participate and promote this methodology?

Regarding the “battle of the best practices”, 
organizations in the public and private sectors are often faced with decisions about which 
practices to adopt as they pursue quality, agility, efficiency; manage risk, and adopt new technologies. 
There are dozens of best practices out there, 
and most of them were created in isolation – relative to the other best practices.

Because the implementation and maintenance methods for many of the best practices are very resource intensive, 
and the scope is not all-inclusive, the organization is faced with the challenge of deciding which to adopt, 
how to do it, and what overlaps, contradictions, and gaps are produced from the resulting collection. 
When EA is THE architecture of an organization in all dimensions, it becomes the over-arching, 
highest level discipline and the authoritative reference for standards and practices. 
This is a tremendous and unique contribution, because when EA is used in this way, 
the dilemma disappears and organizations can use the EA framework to make rational decisions about 
which best practices need to be adopted, 
what they will cover, and how they can relate to each other.
